## Introduction - The project's aim
It would not be wrong to say that mobile games are an important tool of entertainment and having a good time for people of all ages. As a result of increasing interest in mobile games, the idea that mobile games can be used to transfer teaching objectives emerged.

The mobile application which is developed within the scope of the project, is aimed to help first-grade primary school students. In this way, these students can reinforce the subjects which are instructed in the semester. The games which will be included under the name of the project will be developed in accordance with the first-grade mathematics curriculum.
